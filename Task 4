<h3>Education and Struggles</h3>


<p> Kalam was extremely earnest and diligent in his studies, but his teachers recognised him as having a tremendous desire to study. He finished his secondary studies at Ramanathapuram’s Schwartz Secondary School. In 1955, he graduated from Saint Joseph’s College at Tiruchirappalli with a diploma in physics. He subsequently went to Madras to further his education, graduating from the Engineering And Technology Institute with a diploma in aircraft engineering. His dream of becoming a military pilot was crushed when the IAF only had eight slots available, and he finished ninth. Following graduation, he worked as a scientist for the “Defense Research Service” and the “Aeronautical Development Establishment.”</p>





<h3>APJ Abdul ⁴ as a Scientist</h3>

<p>



 On graduation from the University of Madras in 1960, APJ Abdul Kalam returned to the Defence Research and Development organisation Organisation as a scientist (DRDO). He began his career by creating a tiny hovercraft, however his position with the DRDO did not persuade him. APJ Abdul Kalam was moved to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) in 1969 as the project head of India’s first Satellite Launch Vehicle, which successfully launched the Rohini satellite into relatively near orbit in July 1980.



Raja Ramanna also invited APJ Abdul Kalam to see the country’s first nuclear test, Laughing Buddha, as the spokesman of TBRL. However, he had never participated in its development.</p>
